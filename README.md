# PiXL-Public
This is the Public PiXL Repo of our progress

# TLDR;
PiXL is an evoloving RPG on the Tezos blockchain. 

# Main Concepts
PiXL is an RPG (Role Playing Game) that is designed to evolve and constantly change. There are 5 main ideas that are core to project:
1. PiXL is Play-to-Earn - Players are be able to take items they win in the game on markets such as objkt.com
2. PiXL teaches DeFi & Tezos Tech - The game simulates a Tezos ecosystem usingPiXL tez (our own token). PiXLtez is used in-game to sign transactions, create nodes and earn block rewards.
3. PiXL is frictionless - PiXL is on mainnet and uses an entry token to give players access. The entry token only needs to be in the user's wallet and the wallet synced. This is a read-olny call so there are no gas fees.
4. PiXL is for the evnironment - All elements of PiXL are made to have a minimal impact on the evironment. The Quests, enemies and conecpts in the game emphasize the reality of the environmental impact of Proof-of-Work NFTs. (i.e. monsters in the game are dirty NFTs)
5. PiXL is about collaboration - As a love letter to the Tezos community, PiXL will feature colaborations with atrists in the community. It also emphasizes the concepts of Self-Sovereign Identity as players are able to quests with other players while maintaining ownership of the Quest NFT (that has rarity).
